# DragonDraw
![logo](images/Logo.png)

## What is this?

DragonDraw is **an idea repo.**  
Not a finished product, not a Photoshop clone, not another "one-day" promise. It's a space to sketch out what a truly programmable, code-native creative tool *could* look like.  

Think of it as Photoshop, Krita, and After Effects getting raided by ShaderToy, Strudel, and Stable Diffusion, then stitched together with code, plugins, and imagination.

## Core Concepts

- **Code-native brushes & tools**  
  - Write GLSL, TypeScript, or plugins to define how a brush paints.  
  - Brushes can rasterize pixels, generate geometry, or run shaders.  

- **Geometry + Raster in one canvas**  
  - Draw splines, extrude ropes, generate meshes, right next to raster layers.  
  - Photoshop can't: DragonDraw can.  

- **Timeline & Animation**  
  - Keyframes on any parameter.  
  - Export GIFs, sprite sheets, or videos.  

- **AI as a first-class citizen**  
  - Flux, Stable Diffusion, inpainting, texture fills, all via a dead-simple API.  
  - AI isn't the app, it's just another brush.  

- **Community-first**  
  - Share snippets like Strudel or Hydra.  
  - Remix, hack, and trade plugins.

## Why?

Because creative coding deserves better than screenshots from ShaderToy and half-baked Krita plugins.
Because procedural artists deserve tools as flexible as their imagination.
Because painting, coding, geometry, and AI shouldn’t live in separate silos.

## Roadmap (dream version)

* v0.1 — Single canvas, one brush plugin, one shader filter.
* v0.2 — Geometry brushes (splines, ropes).
* v0.3 — Timeline with export to GIF.
* v0.4 — Plugin registry.
* v0.5 — Scene sharing + AI brush integration.

## State of Things

⚠️ **This is an idea.** There is no working app yet.
This repo is here as a **beacon**: a logo, a vision, and a set of docs. If you want to prototype, hack, or contribute, you’re welcome.

## Inspirations

* [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) – live-coded visuals
* [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) – browser-based music coding
* [Krita](https://krita.org/) – open-source painting
* [ShaderToy](https://shadertoy.com/) – shader playground
